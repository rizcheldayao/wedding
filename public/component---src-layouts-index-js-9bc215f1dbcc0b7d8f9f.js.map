Nashville was just the start of our Wanderlust where in short space of time we visited seven countries and countless cities including the beautiful cities of Waco, Texas and Birmingham, Alabama!\",\"Our fondness of each other progressed and we made our first large commitment - we adopted little Autumn, the fluffiest puppy in the whole of Austin! Soon after we took another big step to setting a date and decided to move into a beautiful apartment on the outskirts of gentrification.\",\"For Oliver’s 30th Birthday Rizchel surprised him with a trip to Mexico, where some could say he’d reached the peak of his physical condition and was in the shape of his life. However, the biggest surprise was yet to come as Oliver had planned a proposal that not even Harry or Meghan could compete with. On a hot Winter's night in Cancun Oliver’s elaborate plan came together with the help of family and friends and he proposed to the love of his life. However, after a countless of pranks through their relationship Rizchel thought this was yet another prank…\",\"After a long and emotional speech she realized that this was for reals and said hell

Nashville was just the start of our Wanderlust where in short space of time we visited seven countries and countless cities including the beautiful cities of Waco, Texas and Birmingham, Alabama!\",\"Our fondness of each other progressed and we made our first large commitment - we adopted little Autumn, the fluffiest puppy in the whole of Austin!

On a hot Winter's night in Cancun Oliver’s elaborate plan came together with the help of family and friends and he proposed to the love of his life. However, after a countless of pranks through their relationship Rizchel thought this was yet another prank…\",\"After a long and emotional speech she realized that this was for reals and said hell
